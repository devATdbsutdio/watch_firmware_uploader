# 2.1 Understanding installer\_settings.yaml

```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_ARMv7.tar.gz
```

`.BINARY.LINK`: From where it will download the `arduino-cli` binary. It can be found ****[**here**](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/installation/).

![We are interested in this link](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-27-at-7.05.56-pm.png)





```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_ARMv7.tar.gz
    BASE: /home/pi/bin
```

`.BINARY.BASE`: is the location where you would like to install `arduino-cli.`   The default path in the settings file is `$HOME/bin` . You can, of course, change your installation location here, before firing up the [`installer.sh`](https://github.com/dattasaurabh82/clock_uploader_machine/blob/main/installer.sh)  

> This is important as all the `arduino-cli` based commands will be executed as`/<absolute_path>/arduino-cli` and thus we are not needed to edit any `.bashrc` file to include the binary location in `$PATH`

It doesn't matter to have a trailing `/` at the end of the path. Both will be take care of. :\). For example:

```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: ...
    BASE: /home/pi/bin

# OR
    
BINARY:
    LINK: ...
    BASE: /home/pi/bin/

# Are both valid
```

Next up in the `.ymal` file are the `cores` list. 

```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_ARMv7.tar.gz
    BASE: /home/pi/test
    CORES:
        LINK:
            - http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json
            - https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
```

These are the cores for your micro-controllers that you want to have in your systems installed. Usually some thing you put in your Arduino IDE preference and if using `ardunio-cli` directly, you add them in your cli's config file \[ Here also the script will automatically do so ðŸ˜‡  \]



```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_ARMv7.tar.gz
    BASE: /home/pi/test
    CORES:
        LINK:
            - http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json
            - https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
        CORE_NAMES: 
            - megaTinyCore:megaavr 
            - esp32:esp32
```

Core links, from where this script \(arduino-cli underneath\) will download boards info onto your system are all good. But how do you specially install a particular board group? \(Like you do in Arduino IDE, after you are done with adding the boards url in preferences, you open Boards manager and search for a board group and install it\). Arduino-cli has also already made it easy which is what we use here as well.

The `.BINARY.CORE_NAMES`   are a list of boards \(in arduino-cli world, they are called `FQBN`s \) you want to install in your system.
