# 2.1 Understanding installer\_settings.yaml

```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_ARMv7.tar.gz
```

`.BINARY.LINK`: From where it will download the `arduino-cli` binary. It can be found ****[**here**](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/installation/).

![We are interested in this link](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-27-at-7.05.56-pm.png)





```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_ARMv7.tar.gz
    BASE: /home/pi/bin
```

`.BINARY.BASE`: is the location where you would like to install `arduino-cli.`   The default path in the settings file is `$HOME/bin` . You can, of course, change your installation location here, before firing up the [`installer.sh`](https://github.com/dattasaurabh82/clock_uploader_machine/blob/main/installer.sh)  

> This is important as all the `arduino-cli` based commands will be executed as`/<absolute_path>/arduino-cli` and thus we are not needed to edit any `.bashrc` file to include the binary location in `$PATH`

It doesn't matter to have a trailing `/` at the end of the path. Both will be take care of. :\). For example:

```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: ...
    BASE: /home/pi/bin

# OR
    
BINARY:
    LINK: ...
    BASE: /home/pi/bin/

# Are both valid
```

Next up in the `.ymal` file are the `cores` list. 

```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_ARMv7.tar.gz
    BASE: /home/pi/bin
    CORES:
        LINK:
            - http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json
            - https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
```

These are the cores for your micro-controllers that you want to have in your systems installed. Usually some thing you put in your Arduino IDE preference and if using `ardunio-cli` directly, you add them in your cli's config file \[ Here also the script will automatically do so ðŸ˜‡  \]



```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_ARMv7.tar.gz
    BASE: /home/pi/bin
    CORES:
        LINK:
            - http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json
            - https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
        CORE_NAMES: 
            - megaTinyCore:megaavr 
            - esp32:esp32
```

Core links, from where this script \(arduino-cli underneath\) will download boards info onto your system are all good. But how do you specially install a particular board group? \(Like you do in Arduino IDE, after you are done with adding the boards url in preferences, you open Boards manager and search for a board group and install it\). Arduino-cli has also already made it easy which is what we use here as well.

The `.BINARY.CORE_NAMES`   are a list of boards \(in arduino-cli world, they are called `FQBN`s \) you want to install in your system. The installer will parse this provided array and install them if it can find them in the Arduino repository and not in the system or else if it finds them in the system installed already, it will try to upgrade them. 

> **Note:** A proper FQBN format is used here,  the same one you would use when using arduino-cli



Next up is are about the libraries you want to install in the system.   

```bash
BINARY:
    LINK: https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/arduino-cli_latest_Linux_ARMv7.tar.gz
    BASE: /home/pi/bin
    CORES: 
        LINKS: 
            - http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json
            - https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
        CORE_NAMES: 
            - megaTinyCore:megaavr 
            - esp32:esp32
LIBS: 
    - https://github.com/dattasaurabh82/TinyMegaI2CMaster.git
    - TinyMegaI2C
    - RV8803Tiny
```

The `.LIBS[]` array should contain  either a/many library's name/s or it's/their's git link/s. 

**Is order important here?** 

If using library names and you have one library that has a dependency on another library, you should insert the dependency library first in the file.  

So for ex.ample:

```bash
# The RV8803Tiny library has a dependency on TinyMegaI2C library.
# So insert that one first 
LIBS: 
    - TinyMegaI2C
    - RV8803Tiny
```
